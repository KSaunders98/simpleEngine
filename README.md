# simpleEngine
***WARNING***: Very incomplete and in progress.

The purpose of this project is to provide an easy-to-use, cross-platform library that is capable of rendering 3D objects with simple and powerful code. simpleEngine is built on top of OpenGL and aims to provide easy-to-use APIs while still providing powerful and fast 3D rendering capabilities. This is being developed for fun and is the first program I have written that uses OpenGL. Therefore, it is more of a learning experience, but I hope to make this engine useful for projects to come.

## Dependencies (All cross-platform)
- **GLEW**(GL Extension Wrangler) - Loads in all of the required OpenGL libraries for use
- **SDL**(Simple DirectMedia Layer) - Windowing and input library with OpenGL support
- **SOIL**(Simple OpenGL Image Library) - Used for loading textures
- **ASSIMP**(Open Asset Importer Library) - Used to parse many different 3D object file formats
